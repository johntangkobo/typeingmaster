The name of the software is “SPEED TYPER”, a well-designed and developed instructional
software considered an Educational game which also falls under the category of Drill-andPractice software. 
As cited by Zheng and Gardner (2016), Educational games are those intentionally designed for the purpose of education, 
or those entertainment games that have incidental or educational values. Playing educational games can aid in the 
development of problem-solving abilities, domain knowledge, and concept comprehension. On the other hand,
Drills, as systematic exercises for reinforcing specific skills through repetition and practice, have
shown significant benefits across various fields. 

Research has demonstrated the effectiveness of the drill method in improving movement development skills for children with 
cerebral palsy (Azhar, 2023), enhancing ablution skills in students (Nasution et al., 2023), and boosting learning outcomes 
in English subjects at elementary schools (Yusuf et al., 2023). 

Moreover, studies have explored the impact of extensive training labelled as a drill on coping with critical situations,
highlighting the importance of incorporating explanatory background knowledge into training programs for successful adaptation 
to surprise events (Born & Lehner, 2022).

Speed Typer is designed to help first-time learners in typing and also for those familiar with keyboard skills. 
It is basically geared towards helping learners to enhance their typing speed using
the computer keyboard. It is flexible to use and has a few features which learners can make use of as they start to use the application.

Features of Speed Typer Instructional Material
i. Difficult level: Ranging from “Easy” to “Medium” to “Hard”. Learners will select one
best suitable for his or her strengths and skills.

ii. Time Indicator: Shows the amount of time available for the user. It automatically
adjusts upward as the learner's performance increases depending on the difficulty level.

iii. Score(s) Indicator: Keeps counts of learner’s scores as he or she progresses in the
typing.

iv. Typing Area: A rectangular box where randomly generated words are to be typed for
confirmation or verification by the system in order to progress.

v. Pause/Play button: Used to break and resume the instruction program. When the
“Pause” is activated, the time indicator stops reading the time and the whole program
is at a halt. Whereas, when the “Play” is activated, the program resumes to section again
and the “Time indicator” continues to count down.

Speed Typer is visually designed to suit even a newbie in the field of computing. Specifically,
focusing every type of learner, even those with hearing impairment. On the other hand, it is only
a challenge for visually impaired learners. This group of people would not be able to use this
learning material.
